When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When I work on a project from multiple locations or when I am collaborating with other contributors,
    so that all can view, clone and update the official common version of the repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I might not want to implement the change made in the remote repository
	by another contributor or because I am currently trying out some version of
	my own.
